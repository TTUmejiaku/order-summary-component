## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this challenge helped built up my muscle memory regarding how wonderfull positioning: relative & absolute can be. I learnt how to style background image properly.

The css code below was helpful:

```css
.bg-img {
  background-image: url(./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  height: 50vh;
  z-index: -1;
}
```
